1. It is free to use by everyone (pay for enterprise version, Ansible tower).

2. It is very consistent and light weight and no constraints regarding the OS or underlying hardware are present.

3. it is very secure due to agentless capabilities and open ssh security features
 
4. it uses YAML language (yet another markup language).

5. PUSH Mechanism (we will push forcefully from Ansible server to node servers)

============Important Terms==============================

Ansible server-> the machine where ansible is installed and from which all task and playbooks will be run

Module-> Basically, a module is a command or set of similar commands meant to be executed on the client-side.

Task-> A task is a section that consists of a single procedure to be completed.

Role-> A way of organising tasks and related files to be later called in a playbook.

Fact-> Information fetched from the client system from the global variables with the gather-facts operation.

Inventory-> File containing data about the ansible client servers.

Play-> Execution of a Playbook.

Handler-> Task which is called only if a notifier is present.

Notifier-> Section attributed to a task which calls a handler if the output is changed

Playbooks-> It consists of code in YAML format, which describes tasks to be executed.

Host-> Nodes, which are automated by ansible.
